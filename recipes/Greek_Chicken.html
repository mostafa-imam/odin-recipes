            <h2>Sunny Citrus, Savory Herbs: A Grecian Chicken Odyssey</h2>
            <p>Imagine the Aegean breeze kissing your skin as you savor this vibrant Greek chicken dish. Juicy chicken basks in a symphony of lemon, oregano, and garlic, creating a symphony of flavors that transports you straight to a whitewashed taverna nestled by the sea.</p>
            <p>Serve this Grecian masterpiece nestled alongside a vibrant salad of sliced tomatoes, their sweetness a perfect counterpoint to the herbs. Crumbled feta cheese adds a salty, creamy counterpoint, while toasted garlic bread soaks up every delectable drop. It's a feast for the senses, a culinary postcard sent from the heart of the Aegean.</p>
            <h3>INGREDIENTS</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Â½ cup olive oil</li>
                <li>2 lemons, juiced</li>
                <li>3 cloves garlic, chopped</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh rosemary</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh thyme</li>
                <li>1 tablespoon chopped fresh oregano</li>
                <li>1 (4 pound) chicken, cut into pieces</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>STEPS</h3>
            <ol>
                <li>Mix olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, rosemary, thyme, and oregano in a glass dish. Place chicken pieces in the mixture; cover and marinate in the refrigerator, 8 hours to overnight.</li>
                <li>Preheat an outdoor grill for high heat and lightly oil the grate.</li>
                <li>Place chicken on the grill, and discard the marinade. Cook until chicken is no longer pink at the bone and the juices run clear, about 15 minutes per side (smaller pieces will not take as long). An instant-read thermometer inserted near the bone should read 165 degrees F (74 degrees C).</li>
            </ol>
