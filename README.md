Welcome to odin-recipes!

Here, I've documented my adventure in learning HTML. This place is all about simple, mouthwatering recipes laid out using HTML—nothing too fancy, just good food presented in a web-friendly way.

Take your time, look through the recipes, check out the code—I've been using HTML to make these pages both practical and good-looking.
